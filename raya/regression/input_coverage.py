"""input_coverage.py — is the bot USING every argument the campaign sends it?

The bug this closes (D68, 2026-09-04). Maya outbound asked every caller for their area from scratch.
Three detectors flagged it, and it survived a fix to the confirm branch and a fix to the closed set,
because neither was the cause: `${location}` appears 9 times in the KKB Signals master and **zero**
times in any Maya prompt, while the campaign had been sending it all along. The open ask was not a
mis-ranked branch — it was the only reachable one.

Nothing in the prompt was wrong, so no amount of reading the prompt finds it. Something was ABSENT.
The only way to see it is to compare what the platform actually sends against what the prompt knows,
per bot — a variable declared in the master says nothing about the mirror or a spin-off.

REPORTS, per conversation bot with a prod uuid:
  UNUSED ARG   an agent_args key seen on real calls that the prompt never mentions -> being paid for
               and thrown away. This is the D68 class and it is a hard finding.
  UNSENT VAR   a ${var} the prompt reads that no recent call carried. Informational: it may be a
               genuinely optional field, or the campaign may have stopped sending it.

Keys that are platform plumbing rather than content are ignored (see IGNORE).

Usage: python3 raya/regression/input_coverage.py [--limit 40] [--agent <id>]
Exit 1 if any UNUSED ARG is found.
