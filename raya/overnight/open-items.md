# Open items for Parth — decisions/actions I left to you

As of ~02:50 IST 2026-07-30 (overnight run). These are things I deliberately did NOT auto-fix — either dicey (could be a harness artifact), needing a real call I can't place, needing backend info, or a data/campaign issue outside the prompt. Each has the evidence + a ready-to-go fix if you approve.

## 1. Verify the INBOUND fixes with a real inbound call (can't be harness-tested)
- **What:** KKB inbound Hi (`b6222233`) + Kn (`4ac90bf1`) got the **D31 new-caller apply fix** (create→WAIT→apply, no batching) + **D34 neutral hold**. Both are DEPLOYED + rollback-snapshotted, but **verify-pending** — the tester agent can only RECEIVE calls, so it can't dial an inbound bot to test it.
- **On you:** place one real inbound call to each as a NEW caller (no profile) who picks a job + consents → confirm `create_profile` fires, then `apply_job` succeeds (no 404). If it still 404s, see item #8.
- **Alt I can build:** give the tester an `out_did` so it can DIAL the inbound bot's `in_did` (inbound harness). Needs your OK to modify the tester config / a spare out_did.

## 2. kkb-kn-out — create_profile sent a MALFORMED phone → HTTP 400 (dicey: harness artifact vs real)
- **Evidence:** harness call `fa530906` — `create_profile phone:"+9197946350285"` → `400 "Invalid Indian phone number format"`. The seeker couldn't be created → apply failed.
- **Why dicey:** in the harness, `${contact_phone}` binds to the tester DID, so the malform may be a DID artifact. But production OUTBOUND calls pass `contact_phone` already `+91`-prefixed (e.g. `+916364306440`), and the template prepends `+91` again → the same double/malformed shape would hit real seekers who answer. No real outbound transcript exists to confirm (outbound calls mostly go unanswered).
- **Ready fix (needs your OK / a real-call confirmation):** the **exactly-one-`+91`** composition (D17/D39 direction) — use `contact_phone` as-is if already `+91`, else prepend once; never double. Port-ready to kkb-kn-out (confirmed malform). **NOTE: Maya-out create_profile phone was CLEAN (single `+91`, call `baf836fe`) — so this is NOT universal; it's specific to kkb-kn-out's phone template** (kkb-hi-out unconfirmed). I held off because it's a live production bot and whether real (non-harness) outbound calls malform is unconfirmed.

## 3. Phone double-prefix LATENT on kkb-hi-out + maya-hi
- Analyser flagged the `+91`-hard-prepend template; no real repro found (inbound siblings send a single `+91`). Same **exactly-one-`+91`** fix as #2 is ready. Bundle with #2 if you want it applied.

## 4. DKB phone format — Kn `create_job` example uses bare 10-digit, Hindi uses `+91`
- **Evidence:** DKB Kn `create_job`/`update_job_details` examples show `"phoneNumber":"9108790249"`; Hindi shows `"+919108790249"`. The write may silently fail if the backend keys on one format.
- **On you / backend:** confirm the up-postjob required `phoneNumber` format. If `+91…`, I'll align the Kn examples + add an exactly-one-`+91` rule. (Not changed tonight — needs the backend answer.)

## 5. DKB scheduled agent_args are field-misaligned (DATA issue, not prompt)
- **Evidence:** real DKB calls have `city:"200"`, `salary:"Sector 63, 201309"` (an address in the salary field), `job_role:"Not Available"`. The campaign is populating `agent_args` wrong.
- **On you / data team:** fix the DKB campaign's arg mapping. No prompt change can fix mis-supplied inputs.

## 6. Memory-substitution (D32) — confirmed LATENT, left as-is
- kkb-hi-in + kkb-kn-out: the memory-resume opener does NOT actually substitute for get_profile in real/harness calls (fetch still fires; bot doesn't assert stale memory). Left the opener unchanged. **Decision:** if you want the belt-and-suspenders neutral-opener + "memory-is-not-a-fetch" guard (as on the Signals bots) anyway, say so — it's port-ready.

## 7. Tester harness limitations (for richer testing)
- **One tester DID** → can't run different scenarios in parallel (callee gets no agent_args; one persona at a time). More tester DIDs = parallel scenario testing.
- **Signals has no delete route** → the tester DID's Signals profile can't be reset to "new"; new-seeker Signals paths can't be re-tested on it. A reset/delete or a second dummy number would help.
- **Inbound bots** can't be harness-tested (see #1).

## 8. D31 fix has a runtime tool-adherence residue (watch on verify)
- The KKB-inbound apply-404 was partly the model *hallucinating* a profile_id / skipping create_profile. The deployed fix removes the batching language (should hold), but if a post-fix real inbound call STILL shows a fabricated/empty `profile_id`, prose won't be enough → needs a **platform/tool-schema backstop** (e.g. Raya capturing the create_profile response into a variable the apply step must use). Flagging so we escalate to LitWiz rather than piling on prose.

## 10. kkb-kn-out — apply_job → HTTP 404 "Invalid or missing profile_id" on the KARNATAKA BAP endpoint (BACKEND — FLAGGED)
- **Status:** `Flagged - Backend Issue`. Grounded in harness calls `7e5e1173` + `ab930586` (2026-07-30).
- **Evidence:** on `kkb-kn-out`, the fetch-driven flow ran correctly — `get_profile` (empty) → `create_profile` **SUCCESS** returning a valid UUID `profileId` (`5822b168-…`) → the bot passed that exact `profileId` to `apply_job` → `apply_job` returned **404 "Invalid or missing profile_id"** at `https://onest-lite-bap.dhiway.net/api/v2/apply` (for BOTH job attempts). So the bot behaved correctly; the apply endpoint rejected a well-formed, freshly-minted profile id.
- **Likely cause (yours to judge):** cross-ecosystem mismatch — `create_profile` writes to `jobs-onest-interface.dhiway.net` with `agentId: up-getjob`, but the Kannada bot's `apply_job` posts to the **Karnataka** BAP `onest-lite-bap.dhiway.net`. A profile minted in one ecosystem may not resolve on the other's apply. OR the Karnataka apply endpoint is degraded/deprecated.
- **IMPORTANT — endpoints are correct, do NOT "fix" by re-pointing:** I briefly mis-diagnosed this as endpoint *drift* vs the Hindi (UP) twin and PATCH-aligned kkb-kn-out's `get_profile`/`apply_job` to the UP hosts — **reverted immediately** on your correction ("karnataka doesn't use those endpoints"). Live config is back on the Karnataka endpoints; net change = none. (Analyser C10 + deploy-history updated to record this.)
- **On you / backend:** confirm whether real Karnataka outbound applies succeed in production, or whether the Karnataka apply path genuinely 404s. If it 404s for real users, no Kannada outbound application ever completes → needs a LitWiz/backend fix (align the create/apply ecosystems or repair the Karnataka BAP). Not a prompt or Raya-config fix.

## 11. kkb-kn-in — inventory JSON contradicts its own descriptor/synonym/sample prose (localization gap; may also be out of sync with live)
- **Status:** NEW finding (surfaced while building the combined bots; confirmed by direct read of the file, not a subagent claim). Needs your call.
- **Evidence (`KKB/KKB Placeholder Inbound Kannada.md`):** the hardcoded **JSON inventory** (lines ~92-164) is **Karnataka industrial** roles — Fitter, Welder, CNC Operator, Machine Operator, Mechanic, Assembly Trainee, Electrician (Hubballi/Dharwad/Belur). But the **"What's available" descriptor** (line 359), the **synonym-matching rules** (362-369), and the **sample dialogues** (1453, 1465, 1519) describe **UP/NCR retail** jobs that are NOT in that JSON — Team Member (Burger King), Crew Member (McDonald's), Fashion Assistant (Pantaloons), Sales Rep (Westside), Customer Support (CY Future Noida / Weavings Greater Noida), locations Ghaziabad/Noida/Greater Noida/Meerut.
- **Effect:** a Kannada inbound caller could be told about Burger King/McDonald's/Ghaziabad jobs that don't exist in the bot's real inventory, and "Team Member"→"Burger King" synonym matches point at absent jobs. This is a **localization/sync gap** — when kkb-kn-in was built from kkb-hi-in, the JSON was localized to Karnataka but the surrounding descriptor/synonym/sample **prose was not**.
- **Extra wrinkle:** the git log shows a live reconcile that pulled **"Burger King/CIEL HR"** inventory — i.e. the LIVE kkb-kn-in inventory may actually be the UP/retail set, in which case the **repo JSON (Karnataka)** is the stale half. So before fixing, **reconcile the live kkb-kn-in** (`scripts/raya_deploy.py pull kkb-kn-in` or the browser sha) to establish which inventory is authoritative, THEN align the descriptor/synonym/sample prose to match it.
- **Why not auto-fixed:** it's a non-trivial prose rewrite on a LIVE inbound bot that can't be harness-tested, and the authoritative inventory must be settled first. Ready to do once you confirm the direction.

## 9. Maya — D31 NOT present (false alarm); real exposure is D34
- **Corrected:** Maya does NOT carry the D31 create→apply batching. `Maya/Maya Hindi.md` line 457 uses a different design — `create_profile` runs EARLIER in the flow, so apply is `apply_job` alone (no same-turn create+apply). The analyser's D31-flag-on-Maya was a stale heuristic; **no Maya D31 fix needed.**
- **Real Maya exposure: D34 — CONFIRMED ACTIVE + FIXED.** Maya-out test `baf836fe` showed the create_profile hold narrated; ported the neutral-hold fix → DEPLOYED maya-hi-out `47fdffe6` + maya-hi-in `df99f501` (inbound verify-pending). Maya's distinctive features all confirmed WORKING in the same call: campus identity, feminine voice, student gate, and the MPL Competition offer (first live observation). So no residual Maya action beyond the inbound verify.
