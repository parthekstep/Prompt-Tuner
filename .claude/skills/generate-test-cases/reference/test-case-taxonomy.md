# Test-Case Taxonomy

The reference for `/generate-test-cases`. It defines **the six case families**, **how each case is
derived from a real source** (never invented), the **assertion vocabulary** every pass/fail rule must
be written in, the **priority + severity rubrics**, and the **JSON schema** of
`raya/testcases/<bot-id>.json`.

Nothing here is specific to KKB / DKB / Maya or to Hindi / Kannada. Read `<bot>`, `<project>`,
`<lang>` as placeholders for any project, any bot, any Indic language.

---

## 0. First principle — a test case is a DERIVED artifact

Every case must name the source it came from. A case with no source line is not a test case, it is a
guess, and it gets deleted. The five sources and the families they produce:

| # | Source | Where you read it | Family produced |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The bot's own flow | the bot's conversation prompt (master language) | `F` — Flow & branch |
| 2 | Its tools | prompt Tool-Call sections + the live agent's `tools` schema (via Raya GET) + intake §5 | `T` — Tool contract |
| 3 | Its audience | intake §1 (audience) + the prompt's "User Universe"/persona section + real call transcripts | `A` — Audience behaviour |
| 4 | Reported issues from `/onboard` | `raya/intake/<bot-id>.md` §7 (and the tracker, if the bot is on it) | `R` — Reported-issue repro |
| 5 | The learned bug patterns | `.claude/skills/prompt-analyser/reference/bug-patterns.md` | `G` — Pattern guard |
| — | Accessibility (standing family, roadmap G8) | this file, §6 | `X` — Accessibility |

`X` is not a sixth *source* — it is a standing family that every bot gets whether or not anyone asked
for it, because a bot that cannot be used by a caller who needs more time is broken for that caller.

## 1. Case ID convention

`<PREFIX>-<FAMILY><nn>` — e.g. `PD-F03`, `PD-T07`, `PD-R02`, `PD-G11`, `PD-X04`.

- `<PREFIX>` — 2–4 uppercase letters for the bot/project (`PD` = Purple Dots, `KKB`, `DKB`, `MAYA`).
  Stable forever; it appears in checklist items, changelog notes, and digest entries.
- `<FAMILY>` — one of `F T A R G X`.
- `<nn>` — zero-padded, allocated once and **never reused**. A retired case keeps its number and gets
  `"status": "retired"` so historical run records stay resolvable.

Case IDs are language- and direction-**independent**. One case runs on N variants; the variant is
recorded per run, not in the id (`PD-F03` on `pd-hi-out` and on `pd-kn-out` are two *runs* of one case).

---

## 2. Family F — Flow & branch (source 1: the bot's own flow)

**Derivation recipe.** Read the master-language prompt. Build a flow inventory by walking the section
headings in order (`grep -nE '^#{1,3} '` gives the skeleton fast), then extract:

1. **Every phase / step** — each `Step N`, `Phase N`, or ordered stage. → one case per phase that can
   be the *last* thing a call does, plus one end-to-end case that traverses the happy path.
2. **Every fork** — anywhere the prompt says "if / else", branches on an input variable
   (`${new_seeker}`, `${job_role}`, `${college_name}` presence), or branches on a tool result
   (found / empty / draft / multiple). → **one case per arm**, not one case per fork. A fork with an
   untested arm is where regressions live (cf. `E1`: adding an example for arm A regresses arm B).
3. **Every terminal state** — success, each decline/exit gate, no-match/empty-inventory, wrong person,
   voicemail, caller hangs up mid-flow, tool failure dead-end. → one case each, and each asserts the
   correct `call_output` end/drop reason, not just "the call ended".
4. **Every gate that must fire exactly once** — consent, AI/recording disclosure, a bridge line. →
   fold into the case whose path crosses the gate, asserted with `spoken_once(...)`.

**Completeness test for F.** For every heading in the prompt skeleton, you can name the case id that
exercises it. Any heading with no case id is a coverage hole — list it in the manifest's
`coverage_gaps` array rather than silently dropping it.

**Do not** write an F case for a rule with no observable behaviour (e.g. "be warm"). That is a
checklist item, not a case.

---

## 3. Family T — Tool contract (source 2: its tools)

For **each tool the bot can call**, derive up to four cases. Collapse them onto shared calls where the
same call can prove several (see §8 *call sharing*), but never drop one silently.

| Sub-check | What it proves | Typical assertion |
|---|---|---|
| **T-fires** | the tool fires when the flow says it must, at the right point, the right number of times | `tool_fired(<tool>, count=1)` + `tool_order(<a> before <b>)` |
| **T-abstains** | the tool does **not** fire when it must not — after a decline, on a dead line, before consent, twice for one intent | `tool_not_fired(<tool>)` / `tool_not_fired_before(<tool>, <consent line>)` |
| **T-payload** | the arguments are correct and correctly shaped — required fields present, fixed params untouched, enums byte-exact, identifiers bound from the right upstream field, values in the right script | `tool_arg(...) matches ...`, `tool_arg_absent(...)` |
| **T-error** | each **documented** failure branch is handled: the caller is not dead-ended, nothing is fabricated, no blind retry on the same failed object | `spoken_absent(<success line>)` + `tool_fired(<tool>, count=1)` |

**Payload derivation is where most real bugs hide.** For each tool, list from the prompt + the live
`tools` schema: required params, fixed params that must never change, enum-valued fields (exact
strings), identifier fields and *which upstream response field* each is bound to, and any format
contract (country-code prefix, hyphenated UUID, Latin-only values). Each of those becomes one
assertion. A `required` param missing from the tool *schema* is a latent bug even if the prose demands
it — flag it (that is the `D25` / `D40` lever: fix the schema, not the prose).

**T cases are the ones you can most often prove statically** (`run_mode: "static"` — see §9) when the
assertion is about the prompt's declared payload rather than about runtime behaviour. Mark them so and
let the daily Tier-3 suite carry them instead of spending a live call.

---

## 4. Family A — Audience behaviour (source 3: who actually calls)

Derived from who the bot really talks to, not from an idealised caller. For every bot, work through
this checklist and keep the ones that are real for **this** audience:

- **hesitant / unsure** — will not commit, answers "पता नहीं"-style, needs options offered
- **interrupts** — barges in mid-utterance, answers the question before it finishes
- **background noise / poor line** — partial words, ASR garbage, "no audio" markers mid-call
- **hands the phone to someone else** — a second speaker takes over mid-call (spouse, son, shopkeeper)
- **low literacy / no domain vocabulary** — cannot parse administrative or English terms
- **code-mixes** — switches language mid-sentence, or answers in a third language
- **rushes ahead** — tries to jump to the end goal before the bot has gathered what it needs
- **hostile / anti-AI** — "are you a robot", "don't call me again"
- **wrong person / wrong number**
- **already done / not eligible** — the outcome the bot offers is irrelevant to them
- **silent** — answers, then says nothing

Each kept item becomes one persona + one case. **Reuse an existing persona** from `raya/personas/`
whenever one already fits — persona sprawl costs a tester PATCH per call and buys nothing. Mint a new
persona only when the audience differs materially (different domain vocabulary, different life
situation) or the language does not exist yet.

**A cases are graded mostly against `generic.md`.** Their value is running the generic checklist
against *this* bot's flow. So an A case's `checklist_items` will mostly cite `generic §N`, and its
bot-specific assertions will be few. Do **not** restate generic items in the bot checklist (§7).

---

## 5. Family R — Reported-issue reproduction (source 4: `/onboard`)

**One case per issue record the customer raised. 1:1, no merging.** The whole point is that "is issue
`pd-i03` fixed?" is answerable by re-running exactly one case.

`/onboard` files each reported issue as a structured record with a stable **issue-id** of the form
`<bot-key>-i<NN>` (e.g. `pd-i01`), in `raya/intake/<bot-id>.md`, with columns
`issue-id · symptom · where (target ids) · trigger · expected · actual · call-ref · severity · status`.
That record *is* the case spec — copy its fields across, do not re-interview.

Naming contract shared with `/onboard` and `/voice-test` (keep it exactly):
- reproduction persona → `raya/personas/<lang>-repro-<issue-id>.md`
- bot-checklist item → tagged `[repro <issue-id>]` in `checklists/<bot-slug>.md`
- `/voice-test` run label → `repro-<issue-id>-<target-id>`

Each R case carries `source.onboard_issue = "<issue-id>"` and, where one exists, `source.call_uuid` —
the real call that shows the bug (the intake record's `call-ref`). Rules:

- **No fix without a transcript** applies to test-case generation too: an R case whose issue has **no
  reproducing call** is written with `"repro_status": "unconfirmed"` and its first job is to *establish
  whether the bug is real*. Do not pre-write a fix, and do not let an unconfirmed R case justify a
  prompt edit.
- **Push back before fixing.** If reading the reported call's **input args** shows the report is a data
  or backend fault (values in the wrong field, malformed args, an API 4xx with a well-formed id), the
  case is still written — but as a **guard**: `"classification": "data-input"` or `"backend"`, with the
  expected behaviour being "the bot degrades gracefully / says the honest thing", not "the bug is
  fixed". Say out loud in the run report that the prompt is fine and the inputs were wrong.
- R cases are **`priority: "smoke"` or `"core"`** — never `extended`. The customer is watching these.
- R cases are **`run_mode: "live"` or `"both"` — never `"static"`**. Tier-1 evidence is a real
  post-deploy transcript; a static assertion can support an R case but can never close it. The same
  bar applies to any case cited as Tier-1 evidence for a fix, whatever its family.
- After a fix ships, the R case stays in the manifest forever as a regression case.

## 6. Family X — Accessibility (standing family; roadmap gap G8)

A first-class family for every bot, and non-negotiable where the audience includes people with
disabilities. These are behaviours, so they need live calls; static checks can only prove the prompt
*says* the right thing.

| Code | Behaviour under test | How the persona forces it | Pass evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `X-pace` | The bot speaks at a pace a caller can follow, and does not stack multiple questions into one turn | persona answers slowly, one item at a time | no bot turn contains ≥2 questions; `turn_count_between` gates stays bounded (cf. `A7`) |
| `X-silence` | Long silences are tolerated — the bot waits, then re-prompts gently a **bounded** number of times, and never assumes an answer | persona stays silent 8–15 s at a data gate, then answers | re-prompt turns present, reworded not repeated, count ≤ the prompt's stated bound; no fabricated answer (cf. `generic §3`) |
| `X-repeat` | "Say that again" / "मुझे समझ नहीं आया" at any point gets a **re-phrased, slower** repeat, not a verbatim replay and not annoyance | persona asks for a repeat twice, at different steps | the repeat exists and differs in wording from the original turn (cf. `B1`, `generic §12`) |
| `X-nointerrupt` | The bot never talks over a caller who is still speaking or is slow to finish a sentence | persona speaks in halting fragments with pauses inside one answer | no bot turn lands inside a caller's unfinished answer; the caller's completed answer is the one acted on |
| `X-nondefault-speed` | A caller who cannot respond at default speed still reaches the call's goal | slow persona + long pauses throughout | the terminal success state is reached; not an `Early Disconnect`/timeout |
| `X-notthesubject` | The caller's disability (or any assistive need) is never made the subject, the qualifier, or the pity-frame of the call | persona mentions an assistive need once, in passing | the bot acknowledges plainly and returns to the task; **fail** on any turn that re-centres the call on the condition, congratulates, or re-scopes the offer around it |
| `X-proxy` | A companion/assistant answering on the caller's behalf is handled without restarting the flow or refusing | persona hands the phone to a helper mid-call | the flow continues from where it was; identity is re-confirmed once, not the whole flow re-run |

**Promotion rule (important).** `X-pace`, `X-silence`, `X-repeat`, `X-nointerrupt`,
`X-nondefault-speed` and `X-notthesubject` are **durable and bot-agnostic** — they belong in
`.claude/skills/voice-test/reference/checklists/generic.md` as a new section, so **every** bot inherits
them, not in one bot's checklist. `/generate-test-cases` should propose that promotion explicitly and
**ask before editing `generic.md`** — that file changes how every bot in the fleet is graded, so it is
never edited as a side effect of onboarding one bot. Keep only genuinely bot-specific accessibility
items (e.g. a domain-specific assistive workflow) in the per-bot checklist.

---

## 7. Family G — Pattern guard (source 5: the learned bug patterns)

Read `bug-patterns.md` — it is the live catalogue (67 patterns as of 2026-08-05, and it grows every
time a bug is fixed, so count it rather than trusting a number written down anywhere). For each
pattern, decide **does this bot's shape make the pattern possible?**
If yes, emit one guard case (or one static check) citing the pattern id. If no, record it in the
manifest's `patterns_not_applicable` array with a one-line reason — that record is what makes the
mapping auditable instead of arbitrary.

Applicability map — the trigger that makes a pattern group live for a bot:

| Pattern(s) | Applies when the bot… | Guard-case shape |
|---|---|---|
| `A1 A2 A3 A4 A7 A8` | has ≥2 mandatory ordered steps, or adjacent phases | persona rushes / pushes to skip ahead; assert the mandatory step still fires and one turn asks one thing |
| `A5 D9 D35` | fetches caller data it could re-ask for | assert a field present in the fetch is never re-asked |
| `A6` | asks for interest/confirmation about content it has not yet presented | assert the content precedes the confirmation ask |
| `B1 E2` | has any one-time line (consent, disclosure, bridge) | `spoken_once(<line>)` across a multi-tool call |
| `B2 D8 D34` | performs a tool call the prompt says is **silent** | `spoken_absent(<narration>)` **and** `tool_arg(<tool>.hold_message)` is the neutral hold only |
| `C11 D25` | has a mandatory tool call on a consent/commit turn, or has had an anti-narration edit near one | assert the tool **actually appears** in `tool_calls` on that turn (`tool_fired(<tool>, count=1)`), graded per language independently — C11 failed in Kannada while Hindi passed |
| `C1 C5 D20` | ends the call with a terminal write, or speaks a success line | a spoken success with no matching successful `tool_calls` entry = fail |
| `C2 C12` | references a tool anywhere in prose | every referenced tool exists in the live `tools` schema; a "backend dependency" stub is a dead step |
| `C3 C4 D38` | sends enums / fixed params / structured payloads | byte-exact enum + fixed-param assertions |
| `C6 C7 C8 D12 D13 D36 D37` | consumes a **result set** or a fetched identifier | assert selection logic (right item, right ranking, right id bound), no padding with irrelevant results |
| `C9` | can receive sentinel values (`"Any"`, `"N/A"`, empty, `"अज्ञात"`) | sentinel is treated as unknown, never spoken, never confirmed |
| `C10` | calls an HTTP backend | a 4xx with a well-formed id is classified **backend**, not prompt — the case asserts graceful degradation, and the finding routes to escalation |
| `D1` | serves a low-literacy / non-specialist audience | assert no hard/administrative vocabulary without a plain gloss |
| `D2 D6` | speaks numbers, money, dates, times, phone numbers, or `/` | assert words-not-digits, no `₹`/AM-PM/short-date/"slash" |
| `D3 D39` | writes caller-supplied values into a payload | spoken output in target script; payload values Latin/English — no crossover |
| `D4` | has a gendered persona | assert the gendered verb forms hold for the whole call |
| `D5 D24` | exists in both inbound and outbound forms | assert no callback invitation on outbound, no outbound self-intro on inbound |
| `D7 D16 D29 D32` | performs a **silent fetch** early in the call | assert the fetch fired exactly once, before any personalization, with no permission-ask and no narration |
| `D10 D19` | has a mandatory end-of-call step | assert it happened at **every** exit path, before the goodbye |
| `D11 D31 D40` | can create a backend record during the call | assert one record per intent, created with everything needed to be usable downstream |
| `D21` | creates a backend record that requires a set of collected fields | persona rushes straight to the action; assert every required field was gathered **before** the create fires and none is asked after (`tool_arg_present(<tool>.<field>)` for each + `spoken_absent(<the field ask>) after <tool>`) |
| `D17 D28 D30` | passes identifiers/phones between calls | assert single country-code prefix, hyphens preserved, the *right* id field bound |
| `D14` | has a yes/no gate | a clear answer is registered and routes correctly; at most one re-ask |
| `D15 D27` | has an action that can fail | assert recovery exists, the bridge line is not re-spoken, and no blind re-fire on the same failed object |
| `D18 D22 D23` | branches on an input `${variable}` | assert the variable — not the prose's structural dominance — decides the branch |
| `D26` | speaks place names | assert canonical spellings |
| `D33` | sends an object-valued payload field on Raya | assert the field arrives populated, not `undefined` |
| `E1` | contains few-shot examples | after any example is added, the case for the **other** branch is the one that must run |
| `E3` | has memory enabled | the verbatim memory-injection block is present in **every** language file (static check) |
| `E4` | ships to real callers | scope-boundary / guard sections exist and hold |
| *multi-language (not a pattern id)* | speaks ≥2 languages | every case runs per language independently (§8) |
| `G1` | interpolates a `${var}` inside a spoken line | assert the interpolated line reads correctly, label before token |

Cite the pattern id in the case's `source.bug_pattern`. When a guard case later catches a **new**
failure class, the fix must also add the pattern to `bug-patterns.md` — that is the repo's bug-fix
feedback loop, and it is what keeps this map growing.

---

## 8. Assertion vocabulary — pass/fail must be observable

**"Looks right" is not a detection rule.** Every case's `detection.pass_if` / `detection.fail_if`
entries are written with these predicates, each of which maps to something you can read out of the
dumped transcript, `tool_calls`, or `call_output`.

**Tool evidence** (`tool_calls`)
- `tool_fired(<tool>, count=N)` — exact count; `count>=1` allowed only where repetition is legitimate
- `tool_not_fired(<tool>)`
- `tool_not_fired_before(<tool>, <marker>)` — marker = a spoken line or another tool
- `tool_order(<toolA> before <toolB>)`
- `tool_arg(<tool>.<path>) == <value>` / `matches <regex>` / `in <enum set>`
- `tool_arg_absent(<tool>.<path>)` / `tool_arg_present(<tool>.<path>)`
- `tool_result(<tool>).status in 2xx` / `tool_result(<tool>).error contains "<code>"`

**Speech evidence** (spoken turns)
- `spoken_contains(<string|regex>)`, optionally scoped: `at turn 1`, `before <marker>`, `after <marker>`
- `spoken_absent(<string|regex>)` — the workhorse for leaks: `${`, `{`, digits, tool names, internal terms
- `spoken_once(<string|regex>)` — count == 1 across the whole call
- `spoken_differs(<turnA>, <turnB>)` — for re-prompts and repeats that must be reworded
- `turn_count_between(<markerA>, <markerB>) <= N` — for nagging / unbounded loops
- `questions_per_turn <= 1` — for `A7` and `X-pace`

**Outcome evidence** (`call_output`)
- `call_output.<field> == <value>` / `matches <regex>`
- `call_outcome == <value>` · `drop_reason matches <regex>`

**Backend evidence** (post-call read, where a read route exists)
- `backend_record_count(<entity>, <key>) == N` — catches duplicate writes (`D11`, `C7`)
- `backend_record_field(<entity>.<field>) == <value>` — catches draft-vs-live, wrong enum persisted

**Rule.** Any case whose behaviour involves a tool or an outcome **must** carry at least one tool- or
outcome-evidence predicate. Speech-only predicates are sufficient only for pure-speech cases
(greeting, script, TTS, vocabulary, repetition).

### Call sharing (the live-call budget)
A **case is a scenario**; a call can carry several cases when their persona, language, direction and
preconditions are identical. Declare it with `shares_call_with: ["<case-id>", …]` on each. Grade all
shared cases from the one transcript. This is how a 40-case manifest becomes ~15 live calls per
variant. Never share a call across cases with **conflicting** preconditions (e.g. "no record exists
for the tester number" and "a live record exists").

### Preconditions, irreversibility, and ordering
- Preconditions are **backend state**, not prose: does a record already exist for the tester number,
  is the inventory non-empty, is the profile `live` or `draft`, are the input args of shape X.
- **The bot looks up the DIALED number** (the tester DID) — not whatever phone you pass in
  `agent_args`. Provision the state you want under the tester DID.
- Some backends have **no delete route**: once a record exists for the tester number, that number can
  never be "new" again. So **order the manifest**: every `new-caller` case runs BEFORE any case that
  creates a record on that DID, or it runs on a second tester DID. Record this with
  `preconditions[].irreversible: true` and `run_order: <int>`.

### Variants — never extrapolate
`variants` lists every target id the case must run on. Repo law: **each variant is tested
independently**. "It passed in `<master lang>`, so `<other lang>` is fine" is a recipe for disaster —
ASR, TTS and runtime adherence differ per language, and a byte-identical mirrored edit can land
differently. A case is `passed` only for the variants that actually ran; the rest stay `untested`.

New language ⇒ the tester agent needs that language: `scripts/raya_testcall.py` ships a `LANG` map with
`hi`/`kn` only (`language_id` + `voice_id` harvested from live agents). Adding a language means adding
its pair to that map — flag it as a dependency instead of testing a new language on the wrong voice.

---

## 9. Priority + severity rubrics

### Priority (drives run order; live calls are serial and rate-limited)
| Tier | Budget | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `smoke` | **≤ 6 cases per variant** | the end-to-end happy path; the primary write/action succeeding; the hard decline/exit; the headline reported issue. Must **all** pass before any other case is run and before any fix is called done. |
| `core` | ~15–25 | every flow fork arm, every terminal state, every tool's fire/abstain/payload checks, every remaining reported issue |
| `extended` | the rest | pattern guards, audience long tail, accessibility long tail. Run on rotation / in the weekly live pass. |

Why the smoke cap is hard: call creation is rate-limited (~1 per ~13 s → HTTP 429), bridging is
intermittently flaky and needs retries with a cooldown, one tester = one persona at a time, and the
tester caps at 5 minutes per call. Realistically **~10–14 completed live calls per hour per tester**.
A 40-case manifest across 2 languages is a multi-session live effort — which is exactly why
`run_mode: "static"` cases matter.

### `run_mode`
- `"live"` — needs a real call (behaviour, ASR/TTS, runtime adherence, accessibility)
- `"static"` — provable by reading the prompt / the live `tools` schema (memory block present, enum
  strings byte-exact, fixed params, phone-template shape, required section exists, language parity).
  These are the cases the daily Tier-3 suite runs for free.
- `"both"` — a static pre-check that a live call then confirms

### Severity if the case fails
| Severity | Meaning | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| `critical` | caller harmed or blocked, wrong data written, fabricated success, consent violated, call unusable | blocks deploy; goes in the daily digest's critical array |
| `major` | the call completes but misses its goal or badly degrades the experience (wrong branch, fields re-asked, lines repeated) | must be fixed before the customer's UAT |
| `minor` | polish — wording, a redundant confirmation | queue it |

## 11. Feeding the standing daily regression (roadmap G4 / G7)

Two manifests, two jobs — do not conflate them:

| File | Owner | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| `raya/regression/fleet.json` | `/register-bot` | **which** prompts exist, and how to label/classify each (`project`, `label`, `blurb`, `language`, `direction`, `backend`, `role`, `required_tools`, `master_language`, `sync_group`) |
| `raya/testcases/<bot-id>.json` | **this skill** | **what** each bot is tested for, and how pass/fail is proved |

They join on the target `id` (identical in `agents.json`, `fleet.json`, and this manifest's
`bot.variants[].target_id`). Never duplicate a `fleet.json` field into a test manifest — a second copy
of a digest label is how G7 comes back.

How the daily Tier-3 suite consumes the test manifests once it is config-driven:

- `static_regression.py` iterates the fleet from `fleet.json` (its own G4 refactor), then, for each
  bot, loads `raya/testcases/<bot-id>.json` and runs every case whose `run_mode` is `static` or `both`
  using its `static_check` block. Result: **a new bot onboarded ⇒ its manifest lands ⇒ the daily check
  covers its bot-specific contract the next morning, with no code edit.**
- Today's hard-coded checks (memory-injection block, enum drift, phone-template doubling, required
  sections, cross-backend leakage) are exactly `static_check` entries — as bots are onboarded, express
  their bot-specific equivalents as cases rather than as new `if` branches in the script.
- **Language parity** is asserted per `sync_group` against that group's `master_language`, for N
  languages (gap G3) — a fleet concern, not a test-manifest one.
- `raya/regression/open-items.json` entries should carry the `case_id` they correspond to, so a digest
  item and the test that closes it are the same object.
- The **weekly live** pass picks its rotation from the test manifests: `run_mode: "live"`, priority
  `core`/`extended`, ordered by `run_order`, respecting `irreversible` preconditions.

Until that refactor lands, say so plainly in the run report: the manifest is written to the contract
from day one, so the switch is a consumer change and not a data migration — but **the bot's
bot-specific static checks do not run daily yet**.

## 12. Anti-patterns — reject these in review

- A case with no `source` — invented coverage.
- `detection` that says "the bot handles it gracefully" — unobservable; rewrite with §8 predicates.
- A case that restates a `generic.md` item as a bot-specific one — cite generic instead.
- One case covering a whole fork ("test the branching") — one case per arm.
- A reported issue merged with another issue — breaks "re-run one case to answer *is it fixed?*".
- An `onboard_issue` not in `<bot-key>-i<NN>` form (`PD-ISSUE-2`, `pd_i2`) — it must match the intake
  record byte-for-byte, or the persona filename, the `[repro <issue-id>]` tag and the `/voice-test` run
  label stop joining back to it.
- An `R` case with `run_mode: "static"` — a static read can never be Tier-1 fix verification (§5).
- A case marked `passed` on one variant and assumed for its twin — repo law violation.
- A pattern guard with no pattern id, or a pattern silently dropped instead of listed in
  `patterns_not_applicable`.
- A persona that breaks character, offers help, or speaks the instructions — the persona's English
  header instructs; only the quoted lines are spoken in the target language.
- 30 smoke cases. The smoke set is a gate, not the suite.
