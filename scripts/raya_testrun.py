"""Run ONE agent-to-agent voice test end-to-end and dump the graded transcript.

A TESTER agent (inbound DID, non-interruptable, short max-duration) role-plays a human persona;
the BOT UNDER TEST (outbound agent) is triggered to call the tester's DID; they converse; we
pull the transcript + call_output to grade against the checklists in
.claude/skills/voice-test/reference/checklists/.

Flow: fire `POST /api/call` (agent_id = bot, to_number = tester 10-digit DID, out_did OMITTED)
-> poll to terminal -> dump bot transcript (with tool_calls) + call_output + the tester leg.

Reality of the platform (learned the hard way — see the /voice-test skill):
  * `POST /api/call` is rate-limited ~1 per ~13s (429 -> back off).
  * Bridging is INTERMITTENT: some dials fail immediately (outcome Failure/Unanswered, dur=0,
    no transcript). We retry the connect CONNECT_TRIES times with a cooldown.
  * Passing out_did explicitly gave 'Unanswered'; omitting it connects.
  * `GET /api/call/{uuid}` LAGS after a call (shows Pending/dur=0 briefly) -> keep polling.
  * The tester (callee) receives NO agent_args -> a scenario cannot be selected per call via
    agent_args; select the persona by PATCHing the tester prompt (scripts/raya_testcall.py persona).
