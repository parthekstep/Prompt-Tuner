# Why: `raya_deploy.py deploy | grep -c DEPLOYED` is wrong in BOTH directions. It reads an
# idempotent "diff: none — Skipping PUT" as FAILED (false alarm, seen on Maya 2026-09-04), and
# earlier in the same session it masked a genuine transient failure because a later line happened
# to contain the word. Match the real outcomes instead.
